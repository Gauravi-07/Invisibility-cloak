# Invisibility Cloak Using OpenCV

This project creates an "invisibility cloak" effect using OpenCV and Python. The program captures a background, identifies specific cloak colors, and makes the wearer appear invisible by blending the cloak with the background.

## Features

- Real-time "invisibility" effect using a webcam.
- Detects cloak color and blends it with the background to create the illusion of invisibility.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy

## Usage

1. Step out of the frame to allow the program to capture the background.
2. Step back into the frame carrying a piece of cloth of a specific color.
3. Watch as the cloak blends with the background, making it appear invisible.
4. Press `q` to exit.
